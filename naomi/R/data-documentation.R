#' 4. Patient-level data are routinely collected by health facility staff using
#'    standard monitoring tools. This file contains facility-level aggregates that
#'    have been generated by facility staff and that were verified from primary
#'    records during quarterly National HIV Program Supervision (coordinated of the
#'    Department of HIV and AIDS). While every effort is made to ensure high data
#'    quality, individual records may not be complete and accurate.

#'    HIV Program Reports and any divergent interpretation may be misleading and is

#'    detailed understsanding of the methods and constraints of the Malawi's National
#'    M&E System.
#'
#' The number of ART by age 0-14 and age 15+ is not reported in aggregate quarterly
#' reporting data. For model illustration purposes, this is approximated as 94% of
#' all ART clients are age 15+ based on Spectrum model outputs which were validated
#' against age distributions from electronic medical records by the Malawi HIV
#' estimates team.
#'
#' Dataset could contain one observation per district per quarter for all 32 districts
#' for all quarters between Q3 2011 and Q3 2018, but the number of observations is
#' fewer than 32 * 29 = 928 due to a few missing observations.
